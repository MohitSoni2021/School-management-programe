# 🏫 School Management Program (Terminal-Based)

This project is a terminal-based school management application developed using **Python** and **MySQL**. It allows seamless management of student records through a simple and intuitive command-line interface. Built with `pymysql` for database connectivity and `prettytable` for formatted terminal output, this project is perfect for beginners learning database integration and backend operations in Python.

## 📌 Features

- Add, view, update, and delete student records
- Display records in a clean table format using PrettyTable
- Persistent data storage with MySQL
- Modular and maintainable code structure
- Beginner-friendly project structure for learning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **MySQL**
- **pymysql** – to interact with the MySQL database
- **prettytable** – to present output in a readable tabular format

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
